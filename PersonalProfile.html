				<h2>Test Results</h2>
			</header>
			<p>The results of these tests are relatively close to what I had expected, depicting me as a person who is 'in between' when it comes to a lot of factors.</br> 
In the learning style test, I am <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=9&V=7&T=4">shown</a> to be an auditory learner- acquiring much of my information through a combination of visual and auditory means. For the most part I believe this is relatively accurate.</br> 
</p>In the Myers Briggs <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/istp-personality">test</a> I was attributed the "virtuoso" personality type. The personality is said to be an adventurous type of personality that is curious and make up only 5% of the population.</br> 

Virtuosos are said to explore ideas through creating, trouble shooting, trial and error and first-hand experience.</br> 
I identify to many of these characteristics but not all of them as I believe a personality is too intricate and complex to be identified through mere personality tests.</br> 

</p>In the Big Five factors test I <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=3.5,2.5,4.3,2.8,3.3">scored</a> highly on extroversion and agreeableness. Yet low scores on intellect/imagination and conscientiousness.</br>
 The results contradict those from the Myers Briggs test further indicating the lack of reliability of these tests- though there is an element of truth to them. This could also just be a case of the Barnum effect however.</br> 
According to these tests I would functional well in a group so long as the members aren't too quiet and aggressively assertive. Having scored high on agreeableness I would supposedly know how to deal with people well due to being able to empathize ad show kindness.
