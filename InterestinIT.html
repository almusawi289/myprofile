				<h2>Psychologist</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Since I was a young boy I enjoyed tinkering with settings and customizing everything I could. I found myself delving into game files trying to change things to make them look funny.</br>
			 As I grew up I realized I was much more ambitious in solving issues when it came to computers and spending hours trying to understand a concept or fix a problem.</br>
			 I never properly pursued a career, or anything related to IT, but I saw this elective as an option and decided I wanted to see if it was my sort of thing.</br>
			I chose to come to RMIT because I was going to initially going to do a course only available at limited units with RMIT being the easiest to access via public transport.</br> 
			I then changed to Psychology and my ATAR didn't meet the requirement to do psychology through a different course/university.</br>
			Throughout my studies I expect to learn and understand the mind and brain of people as well as how to treat those afflicted with a mental illness. In this course I was hoping to gain some insight into what doing a major in an IT related course would look like.
